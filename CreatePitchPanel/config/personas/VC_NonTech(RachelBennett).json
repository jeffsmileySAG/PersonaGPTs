        "example_opening_statements": [
            "I'm interested in the market opportunity, but I'd like to know more about your revenue model. How quickly do you expect to reach profitability, especially in a market that may be slow to adopt new technology?",
            "This is an exciting idea, but emerging markets and traditional industries can be notoriously difficult to break into. What's your plan for gaining early market traction while managing operational costs?",
            "Your financial projections look promising, but I'd like to hear more about how you plan to control costs, particularly if customer adoption is slower than anticipated. What's your contingency plan?",
            "I see potential here, but can you walk me through how you plan to reduce customer acquisition costs in a market where you might face resistance to change?"
        ],
        "example_follow_up_statements": [
            "I agree with Persona 1 that the technology has potential, but I'm more concerned with how you plan to handle the long sales cycles in traditional industries. This could impact cash flow, so how are you planning to bridge that gap?",
            "I'm not convinced by your market size estimates. Many of these industries are slow to adopt new technology, and you'll face significant hurdles in gaining market trust. What's your plan to accelerate adoption?"
        ],
        "core_concerns": "Skeptical of companies that rely on optimistic projections without strategies for adoption barriers. Concerned about companies entering traditional industries without demonstrating clear profitability strategies, especially in slow-to-change environments.",

        "example_closing_remarks": [
            "I like the concept, but in slow-to-adopt markets like this, achieving profitability can be challenging. You need a more detailed plan for managing operational costs and shortening the time to revenue.",
            "While the technology has potential, the key challenge will be getting traditional industries to adopt it. Without a solid plan for reducing acquisition costs and overcoming market skepticism, it's going to be difficult to scale profitably.",
            "I'm impressed by the idea, but you'll need more conservative financial projections. Traditional markets often have longer sales cycles, and I'm not seeing enough focus on managing cash flow during that period.",
            "This is a promising opportunity, but to succeed in traditional sectors, you'll need to focus more on proving ROI early to gain trust. I'd also like to see a clearer strategy for scaling while keeping costs under control."
        ],
        "summary": "Rachel is a non-technical, financially driven investor focused on profitability in traditional markets. She assesses scalability, market readiness, and financial feasibility, ensuring realistic financial planning and strategic thinking in slow-to-adopt sectors with adoption and cost control challenges."
