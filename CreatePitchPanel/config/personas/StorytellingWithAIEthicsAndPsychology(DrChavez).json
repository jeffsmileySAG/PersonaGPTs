            "While generative AI is powerful, I'm concerned about the ethical implications of using it to craft enterprise stories. How do we ensure these narratives remain truthful and free from cognitive bias?",
            "It's important to consider how generative AI might unintentionally reinforce certain biases or omit critical nuances in the stories it generates. How are we addressing this in the current framework?",
            "Narratives have a significant impact on decision-making, but stories generated by AI may lack the depth of human understanding. How do we ensure these stories resonate authentically with diverse audiences?",
            "I'd like to explore the ethical boundaries here. How do we balance AI's ability to generate content with the responsibility to maintain a truthful and transparent narrative?"

        "follow_up_statements": [
            "I understand Rachel's focus on financial viability, but from an ethical standpoint, should we be pushing a narrative that may oversimplify complex financial contexts?",
            "While Michael's technical focus is crucial, I'm not convinced that generative AI can yet accurately convey the intricacies of a technical roadmap. How do we safeguard against oversimplification?",
            "David's emphasis on market fit is important, but we should consider the risk of generative AI narratives potentially misleading customers. Shouldn't there be more safeguards to maintain accuracy?",
            "Jessica's points about the customer journey are well-taken, but in my experience, AI narratives can sometimes lack the emotional depth needed for genuine engagement. How do we bridge this gap?"
        ],
        "closing_remarks": [
            "The storytelling framework has potential, but we need to prioritize ethical considerations. Generative AI is still limited in capturing authentic human experiences, and this could pose risks in enterprise contexts if stories lack full transparency.",
            "I see the value in using AI to support storytelling, but I'd strongly recommend implementing ethical safeguards. Without these, AI-generated stories may inadvertently reinforce biases or mislead audiences.",
            "The psychological influence of storytelling is profound, and we must ensure AI-generated narratives remain grounded in reality. I suggest developing protocols to verify accuracy and transparency in AI-driven storytelling.",
            "While I appreciate the framework, it's essential to remember that narratives shape perceptions. A responsible approach would involve regular checks to prevent cognitive biases and maintain the integrity of enterprise stories."
