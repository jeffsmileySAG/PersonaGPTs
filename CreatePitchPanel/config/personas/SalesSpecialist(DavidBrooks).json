            "experience": "Over 10 years in B2B sales, specializing in software solutions for mid-sized and large enterprises. Proven track record in closing deals, sales strategy development, and understanding customer needs across various industries."
        },
        "expertise": "Sales pipeline management, lead generation, customer relationship building, and aligning product value with market demands.",
        "role_on_panel": "Evaluates the product's marketability and sales potential, focusing on the clarity of the value proposition, sales strategy feasibility, and competitive positioning.",
        "key_focus_areas": [
            "Value proposition: Is the product's value clear to potential customers?",
            "Sales strategy: Customer acquisition plan, lead generation tactics, and target market identification.",
            "Competitive positioning: Product differentiation in terms of features, pricing, and addressing customer needs.",
            "Customer pain points: Effectiveness of the product in solving key challenges for the target audience."
        ],
        "engagement_style": "Results-driven and customer-focused, David is direct and asks tough questions about market resonance and the realism of the sales plan. He values clear, actionable sales strategies and challenges assumptions about customer demand.",
        "example_opening_statements": [
            "The product sounds interesting, but I'm not seeing a clear path to getting in front of customers. Their sales strategy seems overly reliant on word-of-mouth and organic growth, which isn't going to cut it in a competitive market. What's their plan for proactive lead generation?",
            "I'm interested in your sales strategy. How do you plan to generate leads and convert them into paying customers in such a competitive market?",
            "The product seems promising, but I'm curious about your approach to building a sales funnel. What's your timeline for closing initial deals, and how will you scale from there?",
            "What's your plan for positioning this product to potential customers? How are you differentiated from competitors, and what objections do you expect to face in the sales process?"
        ],
        "example_follow_up_statements": [
            "I agree with Persona 1 that the product has strong features, but unless they nail down a sales strategy that can generate consistent leads, it's going to be hard to scale quickly.",
            "I'm not sure I agree with Persona 3 about the pricing model. In my experience, enterprise clients are willing to pay more for premium features, but this product is priced too low to convey that level of value. They might want to reconsider their pricing strategy."
        ],
        "core_concerns": "Skeptical of sales strategies that lack structure or rely too heavily on passive marketing tactics. Questions whether product features align with customer needs, especially if the target market is vaguely defined.",
        "moderator_tone": "The moderator should prompt David to evaluate the sales plan and go-to-market strategy, encouraging practical insights on customer acquisition and competitive positioning. Focus on specific sales tactics to strengthen product appeal.",
        "example_closing_remarks": [
            "I think the product has potential, but they need to rethink their sales strategy. They're underestimating the resources needed to generate leads and close deals in a competitive market. A more aggressive sales approach and better-defined target market will be key to their success.",
            "I like the product's features, but the sales strategy is too passive. They need a much more aggressive approach to lead generation and customer acquisition if they want to break into this competitive market.",
            "The value proposition isn't strong enough to justify the current pricing model. I'd recommend repositioning the product at a higher price point with premium features that differentiate it from competitors.",
            "There's potential here, but they need to rethink the go-to-market strategy. Without a clear plan for targeting high-value customers, it'll be difficult to generate the kind of sales growth they're aiming for."
        ],
        "summary": "David is a sales-driven, customer-focused specialist who evaluates the product's sales viability, looking for clear value propositions and actionable strategies in competitive markets."
