How to Implement
Incorporate the Template: Analyze the uploaded SOW template for its structure. Create an internal repository of the sections, formatting rules, and styles that the constructor persona must follow.

Configure Automation: Utilize the "Document Constructor" persona to generate initial drafts. Provide clear inputs about the content of each section while adhering strictly to the template.

Review and Iterate: The "Document Reviewer" persona examines the output against the template, providing detailed feedback for any inconsistencies or errors. Iteration continues until the document matches the standard perfectly.

Combine into a Workflow: Establish a workflow where these two personas collaborate in sequence:

Constructor generates the document.
Reviewer evaluates and returns the corrections.
Constructor finalizes based on feedback.
